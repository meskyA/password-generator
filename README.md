Password-Generator

The purpose of this project was to generate random secured password using different characters.
I used JavaScript.
When the generate-password button is clicked, the user is prompted how many characters they want. 
The user can choose between 8 and 128 characters.
The options are uppercase, lowercase, numbers and symbols.
With every click, users are prompted to select their choices.
The selected criteria matche the generated password each time.
